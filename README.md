Depression is a major problem in India. According to WHO, [over 5 crore people suffer from depression in India](http://www.livemint.com/Specials/Ysja8QtaVqjRpKg7eAFJfL/Over-5-crore-people-suffer-from-depression-in-India-WHO.html). This project aims at solving the issue through Artificial Intelligence. A chatbot will discuss the problems and issues, a person is facing in their life. It will try to help them itself or connect them through to a counseller.

This is a learner's project and will be completed over a long period.
